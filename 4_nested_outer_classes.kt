/*


A nested class is a class defined within another class. For example, letâ€™s say in the app of the Little Lemon restaurant you have a class Order. This class can have a nested class DeliveryDetails to store information such as a delivery address, delivery fee and so forth.

Note: In this example, Order is the outer class.

class Order {  // Outer class
    val orderId = 1 

    class DeliveryDetails {  // Nested class, class in a class
        val deliveryFeeInDollars = 10 
    } 

} 

println(Order.DeliveryDetails().deliveryFeeInDollars).  // How to acces to the nested class
                                                        // nested class static by default
                                                        // doesn't need an instance
